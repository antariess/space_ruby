space game using Ruby


An attempt to upload a smalls imple game created in Ruby on my local machine.
Game itself done using Gosu gem, pretty much followed the tutorial available on their site, through I added 'down' button to accelarate as well (because I keep pressing it when I dont mean to <_>).
