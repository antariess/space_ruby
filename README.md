# space_ruby
space game using Ruby


Upload of a small simple game I created in Ruby on my local machine.
Game itself done using Gosu gem, pretty much followed the tutorial available on their site, through I added 'down' button to accelarate as well (because I keep pressing it when I don't mean to <_> I mean, if I can't have my fist game to fit me why even make it... ).

To download: get all files (you need to have Ruby installed, created using version 2.4.1) keep .rb file and 'media' folder in the same directory so the links work. Execute using cmd/terminal.
